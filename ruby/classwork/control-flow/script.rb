Each branch of the statement should print something to the console

3. Weâ€™re letting you know what value (true or false) 
we want each variable to have, and your job is to add an expression that evaluates to 
the correct value using comparators.
=end
# test_1 should be false
test_1 = 10 > 20
# test_2 = should be false
test_2 = 1 == 5
# test_3 = should be true
test_3 = 5 != 6


=begin
4. Booleans: The code below indicates what value (true or false) 
we want each variable to have, and your job is to add an expression that evaluates 
to the correct value using boolean operators (&&, ||, or !).
=end

# test_1 should be true
test_1 = (10==1) || (1>-2)

# test_2 = should be true
test_2 =(100< 101) && !(19>20)

# test_3 = should be false
test_3 =(99 ==(9*11)) && (10==9)
